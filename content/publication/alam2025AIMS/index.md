abstract: The two-mode Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov (TMNNV) equation finds wide-ranging utility across engineering and scientific fields. It stands ....

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: This review article mainly analyzes several research articles that are mainly related to machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) based human disease diagnoses, and the model's decision-making process is explained by XAI techniques.
