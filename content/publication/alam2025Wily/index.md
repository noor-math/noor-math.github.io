abstract: The third fractional 3D Wazwaz–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony (WBBM) equation is examined in this paper, along with new waveforms and various analyses.....

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: This review article mainly analyzes several research articles that are mainly related to machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) based human disease diagnoses, and the model's decision-making process is explained by XAI techniques.
