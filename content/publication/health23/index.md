abstract: Low contrasts and visual similarity between different skin conditions make skin disease recognition a challenging task. Current techniques to detect and diagnose skin disease accurately require high-level professional expertise. Artificial intelligence paves the way for developing computer vision-based applications in medical imaging, like recognizing dermatological conditions. This research proposed an efficient solution for skin disease recognition by implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.................. Please click pdf option to read more.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This research proposed an efficient solution for skin disease recognition by implementing CNN architectures. Here, MobileNet achieved a classification accuracy of 96.00%, and the Xception model reached 97.00% classification accuracy with transfer learning and augmentation.
