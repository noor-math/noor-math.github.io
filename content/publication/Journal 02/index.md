abstract: In this research, the modified extended tanh-function (METF) and the extended Jacobi elliptic function expansion (EJEFE) techniques are used to investigate the generation and detection of soliton structures in the Hirota–Maccari (HM) model. Consequently, we obtain soliton solutions with advanced structures, including singular bright soliton, dark soliton, periodic waves, breather waves, periodic breather waves, and multiple bright and dark breather waves. In addition, a lump-type breather wave is also included in the presented solutions. Stability analysis of the obtained solutions is addressed by employing the Hamiltonian technique. 3D surfaces and 2D visuals of the outcomes are represented with the help of a computer application. These findings contribute to understanding nonlinear wave phenomena with potential applications in optics, fluid dynamics, and plasma physics.
