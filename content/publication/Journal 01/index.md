abstract: This research aims to delve into the transient MHD flow over a porous plate having an inclination, with heat and mass diffusion by taking the radiative phenomenon into consideration. The flow controlling equations of continuity, momentum, energy, and concentration are developed using the boundary layer approximations. The radiative flux is described using a differential approximation. The governing time-dependent equations are brought into a conversion to create a system of non-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical schemes approaching the explicit finite difference method (EFDM) are employed to discretize and reckon the equations in dimensional agreement. Stability and convergence checking are prepared to ensure the converging restrictions of pertinent parameters. The profiles of velocity, concentration, and temperature have been illustrated graphically and discussed comprehensively.
