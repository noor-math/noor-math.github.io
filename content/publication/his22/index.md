abstract: In recent days, the number of technology enthusiasts is increasing day by day with the prevalence of technological products and easy access to the internet. Similarly, the amount of people working behind this rapid development is rising tremendously. Computer programmers consist of a large portion of those tech-savvy people. Codeforces, an online programming and contest hosting platform used by many competitive programmers worldwide. It is regarded as one of the most standardized platforms for practicing programming problems and participate in programming contests. In this research, we propose a framework that predicts the performance of any particular contestant in the upcoming competitions as well as predicts the rating after that contest based on their practice and the performance of their previous contests.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  This paper proposed a framework that predicts the performance of any particular contestant in the upcoming competitions as well as predicts the rating after that contest based on their practice and the performance of their previous contests.
